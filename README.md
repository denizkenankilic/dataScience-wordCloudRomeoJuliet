R Code for the Text Mining and the Word Cloud

In this repository, you can find R code that covers text mining, text cleaning, term-document matrix building, and word cloud-generating subjects. The entire play of Romeo and Juliet written by Shakespeare is used as an example text. You can use any other text you want.
