R Code for the Text Mining and the Word Cloud

In this repository there is a R code that covers the text mining, the text cleaning, a term-document matrix building and the word cloud generating subjects. The entire play of the Romeo and Juliet written by Shakespeare is used as an example text. You can use any other text you want.
